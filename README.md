# Atomic Orbitals and Shannon Entropy

This repository contains the project files for the analysis of radial atomic orbitals and Shannon information entropies 
for the first ten elements (excluding Hydrogen) with atomic numbers ranging from 2 to 10. The study involves calculating 
the radial distribution functions in both position and momentum spaces, derived from the Roothaan-Hartree-Fock (RHF) electron 
wave functions, and evaluating their corresponding Shannon information entropies.
